For those who want to host their passwords on a remote server, such as a NAS, you can try using the [BashPass-Remote](https://github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass-Remote) project.
Please note that this project is still in development.
BashPass-Remote allows you to use BashPass as if it were installed on your machine while storing the passwords on a remote server.
The tool is essentially a simple wrapper around SSH and BashPass, which enables you to securely connect to your remote server and use BashPass as if it were installed locally.
Like BashPass, BashPass-Remote is written in (pure) Bash and is compatible with most Linux distributions, BSDs, and Mac OS X (with Bash installed).
For further details, please refer to the BashPass-Remote [documentation](https://github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass-Remote/wiki)
